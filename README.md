## Introduction 

In this section we looking at the evolution in the way we communicate

1. Postal Protocols in Ancient China - Yam Routes Established Across the nation: At it's peak there were 1785 established post offices and 300,000 horses distributed around these offcies. Peak travel time can reach around 400km a day - equal to back and forth trip from London to Toronto

2. Telegraph - Telegraphy is not what would be commonly considered as a "Telegraph"
      - Electrical Telegraph - Five Needle Telegraph vs. Morse Key - employ the use of electro magents - marvelous piece of engineering
      
3. First look at Internet Protocol Suite - 7 layers of Protocal Stack in the ideal Open System Interconnect Reference Model(meant for teaching and demonstratuion hence the name reference - developed around 1977)

### INTERLUDE-Basic Computer Logic 

In order to understand the complexity of the computers and network protocols of today, we need to first take a look at binary logic and the simplest logic gates that constructs the Arithemitic Logic Units inside the computer

Understanding this at a transistor level is a different story and will not be discussed here - second || third year Software/Electrical/Computer Engineer stuff  

  http://nandgame.com/ : Cool Game that lets you construct a ALU units using the simplest logic
  
  https://www.nand2tetris.org/ : if you have a little more time you can play this, building a whole OS from the ground up
 
  https://store.steampowered.com/app/370360/TIS100/ : Repairing an old broken computer, great way to practice logical thinking and learn a thing or two about computer networking 
      
## Connecting the Dots

Throught out this workshop, there will be a lot of abstractions given the complexity and scale of the subject discussed, the key here is to gain a high level understanding, don't fret over small techincal details

The gist of it is - everything on the internet is a computer, including a server 

https://www.lifewire.com/servers-in-computer-networking-817380  
https://www.webopedia.com/Computer_Science/Client_Server_Computing - both links contain excellent laymen explanation 

There are many different types of servers and they each function differently, a lot of servers today are running multiple kernels, load balancers, and shells as well as read and write databases all on the same machine. If we ever get to do a cloud computing work shop we can dive deeper into this subject 

#### Live-Drawing Segment 
Now we switch over to the drawing pad to illustrate the puzzle and iteration problem solving that went into solving the puzzle

- The story of Brad, Chad and Becky and how they talk to each other 

[The Drawings will be updated onto the document]
